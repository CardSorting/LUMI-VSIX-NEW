/**
 * LUMI voice helpers — warm, collaborative microcopy.
 *
 * Design principles:
 * - Can someone keep this open all day without feeling managed by it?
 * - Does this interface reduce tension?
 * - Does this reduce cognitive tension right now? (tired-developer test)
 * - Sustainable pace — not velocity, hustle, or optimization pressure.
 * - Recoverable cognition — observations and possibilities, not judgment.
 * - Archival artifacts — project notes, not infrastructure telemetry.
